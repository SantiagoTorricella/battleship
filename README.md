 ## Descripcion

 This battleship project was the final project of my self-taught education in The Odin Project JS Curriculum. The aim was to implement the us of JEST for better understanding in testing,
 while polishing my skills with JavaScript. Also it was a pretty good challenge on the logical side because of all the game-logic, game-flow , game-rules and so on.
 Also it was a good project to practise and understand classes and factory functions. I used both on the same project and its not a really good practice to do that,but i did it
 only for the better understandance of the matter.

 ## Features
- Singleplayer battleship game against an IA.
- Random placement of ships for the IA
- Manual placement for the player board
