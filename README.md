 ## Descripcion

 This battleship project was the final project of my self-taught education in The Odin Project JS Curriculum. The aim was to implement the us of JEST for better understanding in testing,
 while polishing my skills with JavaScript. Also it was a pretty good challenge on the logical side because of all the game-logic, game-flow , game-rules and so on.

 ## Features
- Singleplayer battleship game against an IA.
- Random placement of ships for the IA
- Manual placement for the player board

 ### To Do
 - More intelligent IA (shoot adjacent grids when make a hit).
